# Agri-Tech-Project
Agri-Tech project for farmers made by team Outlaws.
The project we have made is basically to ease the life of farmers. It links farmers with modern technology so that farmers can easily determine the amount of fertilizers to use as per their budget as our site gives all basic requirements of crops after the farmers inputs the crops they want to grow.
Further on taking our subscription plan(at minimal affordable cost) the farmers can keep of the fertilizers they have used and our system will also suggest the crops they should grow with the fertilizers they should use so that farmers initial expenses will be minimal and the farmer can keep track of their record when they return back to our website.
